    abstract = { A Steiner minimal tree for given points \$A\_1 , \cdots ,A\_n \$ in the plane is a tree which interconnects these points using lines of shortest possible total length. In order to achieve minimum length the Steiner minimal tree may contain other vertices (Steiner points) beside \$A\_1 , \cdots ,A\_n \$. We find conditions which simplify the task of constructing a Steiner minimal tree. Some of these use relationships with the easily constructed (ordinary) minimal tree which achieves minimum length among all trees having only \$A\_1 , \cdots ,A\_n \$ as vertices. Other questions concern the relative lengths of these two trees in extreme or typical cases. A review of the existing literature is included. }

    abstract = { We consider Steiner minimal trees in the plane with rectilinear distance. The rectilinear distance \$d(p\_1 ,p\_2 )\$ between two points \$p\_1 \$, \$p\_2 \$ is \$| {x\_1 - x\_2 } | + | {y\_1 - y\_2 } |\$, where the \$(x\_i ,y\_i )\$ are the Cartesian coordinates of the \$p\_i \$. For a given finite set P of points, let \$l\_s \$ denote the length of a Steiner minimal tree and \$l\_m \$ the length of a minimal spanning tree. The main result of the memorandum is that \${l\_s / l\_m } \geqq \frac{2}{3}\$. }

abstract = {Let Σ be a set of n points in the plane. The minimal network for Σ is the tree of shortest total length LM(Σ) whose vertices are exactly the points of S. The Steiner minimal network for Σ is the tree of shortest possible total length LS(Σ) when the vertices are allowed to be any set Σ′ ⊇ Σ. Clearly LS(Σ) ⩽ LM(Σ), since the minimization in LS is over a larger set. It has long been conjectured that, conversely, LS(Σ) ⩾ (3122) LM(Σ), but this has previously been proved only if n = 3. In this paper, among other results, this is proved for n = 4. Unfortunately the proof is sufficiently complicated that immediate generalization to arbitrary n, no matter how desirable, is unlikely.}
